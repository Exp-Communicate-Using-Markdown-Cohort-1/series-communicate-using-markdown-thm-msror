# Introduction to communicating using markdown
There are different levels of headers which can be initialised by the number of '#' symbols and a space, used before a sentence.
They vary from one '#' symbol for H1 heading to six '######' for H6 heading.

For exmaple: 
###### This is an H6 heading.
